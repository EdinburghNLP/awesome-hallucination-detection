- **Datasets:** OpenDialKG, a dataset that provides open-ended dialogue responses grounded on paths from a KG.

## Taxonomies

[Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03629) classifies metrics in *Statistical* (ROUGE, BLEU, PARENT, Knowledge F1, ..) and *Model-based* metrics. The latter are further structured in the following classes:
- **Information-Extraction (IE)-based**: retrieve answer(s) from a knowledge source and compare it with the generated answer -- there might be problems due to the error propagation from the IE model.
- **QA-based**: measure the overlap/consistency between generation and source reference, based on the intuition that similar answers will be generated from the same question if the generation is factually consistent with the source reference. Used to evaluate hallucinations in summarisation, dialogue, and data2text generation. Composed by a *question generation* model and a *question answering* model.
- **Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based**: based on the idea that only the source knowledge reference should entail the entirety of the information in a faithful and hallucination-free generation.

## Definitions and Notes

### Extrinsic and Intrinsic Hallucinations

- [Neural Path Hunter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08455) defines *extrinsic hallucination* as an utterance that brings a new span of text that does not correspond to a valid triple in a KG, and as *intrinsic hallucination* as an utterance that misuses either the subject or object in a KG triple such that there is no direct path between the two entities.
- [Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03629) defines *extrinsic hallucination* as a case where the generated output that cannot be verified from the source content, and as an *intrinsic hallucination* a case where the generated output contradicts the source content.
